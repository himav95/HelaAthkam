This project aims to develop an e-commerce website for “හෙළ අත්කම්” a Local Sri Lankan Handicraft shop that produces and sells products made from natural materials such as ekel, coconut,  palmyra, reed, and bamboo. “හෙළ අත්කම්” encourages people to use accessories and housewares  made from traditional natural materials instead of plastic.
